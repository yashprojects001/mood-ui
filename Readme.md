## 🌌 What is this?
> _“Most interfaces react to clicks.  
This one reacts to **you**.”_

**Mood-Driven UI** is an experimental web interface that:
- Detects **emotional state** from typing behavior & text
- Adapts **colors, contrast, and tone**
- Persists mood across sessions
- Turns highlighted thoughts into exportable notes
- Builds a **timeline of your emotional flow**

All while staying **privacy-first**.

## 🧠 Intelligence Stack (Not ML, but Smart)
| Signal | What it reveals |
|------|----------------|
| ⌨ Typing Speed | Stress, focus, overload |
| 📝 Text Sentiment | Emotional keywords |
| 🎨 UI Preference | Cognitive comfort |
| ⏱ Time Patterns | Mental energy rhythm |

> ⚠️ No AI model needed — this is **human-behavior intelligence**
